Last time I wrote a [blog post](__GHOST_URL__/dont-start-a-company-to-be-your-own-boss/), it go some good coverage on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6595153).

Since the post was about what starting a company, someone asked why I started Wallaby. I did [write about this](__GHOST_URL__/obligatory-why-i-left-my-job-to-start-a-blog-post/) a bit in early 2012, right after I left AT&T.  I was going to follow-up on my next post on this topic, but its pretty weighty.

Instead, I put it off, and here we are, three weeks later no blog post. I’m way too tired from taking care of the family, having visitors, running Wallaby and kids who sleep poorly.

So here is a short, random blog post, about the fact that I should write more frequently.  Somehow it makes me feel better.  Isn’t that what blogging is really about?
