> Information wants to be free. Information also wants to be expensive. Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to distribute, copy, and recombine - too cheap to meter. It wants to be expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about price, copyright, ‘intellectual property’, the moral rightness of casual distribution, because each round of new devices makes the tension worse, not better.

_Stewart Brand, _spoken at the first [Hackers’ Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hackers_Conference "The Hackers Conference"), and reprinted in the May 1985 _Whole Earth Review_. The quotation is an elaboration from his book, _The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT_, published in 1987.
