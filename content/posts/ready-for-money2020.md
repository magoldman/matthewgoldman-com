I’m headed out this weekend for Las Vegas (or bright and early Monday morning anyway). This conference, in its second year, is huge now, with 4,200 attendees in financial services and payments descending on the Aria in Las Vegas for the week.

Last year, we were over-run at our booth and I didn’t do a great job keeping track of everyone I met and every opportunity we thought of. This year I am looking forward to taking much better care of that.

Much of my team is coming with me to learn, meet people and make some deals. We have some great progress on Wallaby to share with people and are thrilled to be a part of the future of payments. Stop by booth 634 to meet up with Wallaby!

See you at the show!
