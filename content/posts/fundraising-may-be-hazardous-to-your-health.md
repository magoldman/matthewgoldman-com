It has been my intention not to talk about fundraising for my new company, [Wallaby Financial](http://www.walla.by/). It seems like poor form to get into the details publicly.  But an incident today seemed to beg for a write-up.

I have been going around asking people for money _speaking to qualified, accredited investors about the opportunity presented_ for a few weeks now.  It is fun and not fun at the same time. I didn't think it was dangerous, though!  I think it's getting there, however.

I took a day trip to Palo Alto today to meet with some people.  That means an early morning flight to make the most of the day.  Which means getting up early. Given that I have two kids, one who is very young and one who is sick, that means very little sleep was enjoyed.

So I get to my local friendly [Burbank airport](http://www.burbankairport.com/), for a nice easy flight.  While crossing the street from the parking shuttle I did a full on, comical slip with my backpack flying up and over my head.  I had the attention of everyone.  It was not good. I'm OK now, but sore.  No venture capitalists asked about the odd white spot on my pants where I slid on crosswalk paint.

The culprit? Not a banana, but a plastic comb.  To which I have just one word: really?

So, the fundraising goes on.  I just hope it's less painful next time around.
