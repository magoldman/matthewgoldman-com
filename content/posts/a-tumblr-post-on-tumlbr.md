As a startup founder, I can’t help myself from reading every thing about [Yahoo’s billion dollar acquisition of Tumblr](http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/50902111638/tumblr-yahoo). That’s the lottery winning dream of the startup CEO.

I’ve especially enjoyed the always sprited discussion of Marco Arment, former CTO of Tumblr (although not a founder) on his [blog](http://www.marco.org/2013/05/20/one-person-product).

The thing that sticks out to me about the discussion is how much Tumblr Founder/CEO David Karp is a “Steve Jobs-like visionary.” He is dedicated to the product, disdains revenue, etc., etc.  It’s a common story with the big wins–this man had a vision, saw it through and that’s WHY he is successful.

I would hazard an educated guess that there are a lot of founders who have a vision, try to see it through single-mindedly and that is why they are NOT successful.  Not to say David’s vision isn’t amazing–it clearly is. I wish I thought of tumblr, I am enjoying it right now.  But I think there is a [correlation/causation assumption failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation) here. Being a single minded visionary may or may not be required to get to $1B. However, I don’t think that being single-minded is always a good thing–we all know the other side of this story is the once, twice, thrice pivoted startup.

Let’s all acknowledge the whole thing is kind of a crap shoot and that there are so few billion dollar exits (measured in the double digits) and the industries are so varied that it would be hard to run a meaningful regression.
