I have been convinced and concluded myself that the spoonerization of the Fairy Tale of Cinderella was first achieved by Colonel Stoopnagel of radio fame. See what I deem the [original version](__GHOST_URL__/prinderella-and-the-since) and learn more about [Stoopnagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoopnagle_and_Budd).

This next versoin is generally attributed to [Archie Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Campbell). I have a [full recording](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2yomidd4le3g0a/rindercella.mp3?dl=0) of it. I have created [a transcription](__GHOST_URL__/the-story-of-rindercella/) of this version.

I have [another version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8qboaa8gohf1ix/rindercella-clip.mp3?dl=0) which cuts off quite early, but is rather different. Despite the audio version being cut-off, I do have a [full text version](__GHOST_URL__/cinderella-and-her-sisty-uglers), which seems to be the same one. It was written by Jack Ross.

To go along with the Jack Ross version is an **extraordinarily similar** version. Sent to me by Paula M. its [a transcription from a CD](__GHOST_URL__/prinderella-the-cince) she owns of Tom Callinanâ€™s *[Come On An Sing-Along!](http://www.worldcat.org/title/come-on-and-sing-along-tom-callinan/oclc/779613187)* I am suspicious of the originality of this version and attribute its origins to Jack Ross. Normally I wouldn't post something so similar, but the transcription does a lot to show that it is actually a separate version. (It's like a sub-species.)

Next, there is [the version which I've had the longest](__GHOST_URL__/the-story-of-rindercella-2/), which is very close to the transcribed Campbell version.

I was sent [this version](__GHOST_URL__/the-story-of-rindercella-3) to be attributed to [Milburn Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milburn_Stone). Stone was a guest on Dean Martin's weekly TV show and told Cinderella, interactive with Dean Martin. Stone was also Doc on the TV Series [*Gunsmoke*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/).

Then, I received a new version from Alan H of England. To quote Alan:

>"I first heard Rindersella in the early sixties. I have never been to the US and haven't (knowingly) listened to US radio. However, after growing up in England, I moved to Cyprus in 1963 when my father was posted with the RAF. I was about 15-16, and I heard the story on British Forces radio. I must have heard it a couple of times, but could not track down the actual record. It was only years later that I used the internet to figure out it must have been Jack Ross, whose 7" disk reached the US charts in early 1962. Anyway, I was hooked on the idea and developed the story as a party-piece which I started in school later the same year. Subsequently - in the RAF myself and in later life _ have consistently used the routine as an after-dinner piece. I have used it in concerts in the Officers' Mess; at a revue at an Open Prison in Northumberland; to entertain work and sport colleagues. Hundreds have groaned at my version of the story. Having found your website recently, I have compared my version to the original - and there are very few similarities, but a few phrases have survived from the Jack Ross chart-breaker. These obviously stuck in my mind: 'sisty uglers'; 'pransome hince'; 'ears in her ties'; 'mome by hidnight'; 'and you can't change that around!'" 

Check out Alan's [Rindersella and the Prince](__GHOST_URL__/alans-rindersella-and-the-prince).

Ann C sent me a version she *memorized* from her high school news letter. It's yet another fun take on the classic. This makes number seven: Ann's [Prinderella and the Cince](__GHOST_URL__/anns-prinderella-the-cince).

This website is 20 years old and I am starting to think that there are infinitely many versions of this tale. I hope you enjoy them all.
