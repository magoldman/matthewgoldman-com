It’s been a good last week or so. Can’t divulge the details, of course, but it’s nice when things are coming together (or at least seem to be).

I always find that when I’m feeling good the inspiration level goes up as well.  Every day lately I have been thinking of a good user problem, and a way to solve it.  It’s not like I can go build that business, I have to work on [Wallaby](https://walla.by), of course, but it’s fun to think about and it provides some energy.

Or that’s the coffee, three times a day. Hard to tell.
