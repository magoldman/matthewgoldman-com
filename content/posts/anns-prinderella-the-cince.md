*Submitted by Ann C*

T'once upon a wine, there was a gitty little pearl named Prinderella. She lived in a big house with her two sisty uglers and her micked webstother. All day long, poor Prinderella had to wean the clindows and flub the scroors and pine the shots and shams.

One day the Ping issued a kroclamation that all gelligable goung yirls were to attend the drancy fess ball. Poor Prinderella couldn't attend the drancy fess ball, for all she had was a rirty drag. So she cat down and scried!

All of a sudden her Merry Fodgother appeared and said, "Prinderella, why are you crying?" Prinderella replied, "Oh, Merry Fodgother, I can't go to the drancy fess ball, for all I have is a rirty drag." "Oh, you shall go," said the Merry Fodgother, and in an eyeling of a twink, she changed the cumpkin into a parriage and the rirty drag into a drancy fess. "Oh, thank you, Merry Fodgother," Prinderella replied. "Now I shall attend the drancy fess ball." "Under one condition," warned the Merry Fodgother." You must be home by the moke of stridnight!"

So, all night long, Prinderella danced with the Cince, but at the moke of stridnight, she raced down the stralace peps and on the strottom pep, she slopped her dripper!

The next day, the Ping issued another kroclamation that all gelligable goung yirls were to sly on the tripper. The two sisty uglers and the micked webstother slied on the tripper, but it fidn't dit. However, when Prinderella slied on the tripper, it fid dit!

So Prinderella and the Cince lived afterly ever happiworth, but the two sisty uglers and the micked webstother were left all alone in the big house. Now wasn't that a shirty dame?
