> The question was, if Starbucks products are sitting on the grocery shelf, what could we do that leverages the loyalty system of Starbucks? So beginning in the month of June, Starbucks roast and ground coffee sitting on thousands, tens of thousands of grocery shelves across the country, will have a tag affixed to the bag and that customer buys the coffee bag and they will be able to achieve loyalty or stars the same way our customers do in our stores. The initial read on this demonstrates that weâ€™ll be able to create a higher level of velocity and loyalty with grocery customers as a result of their core relationship that they have inside our stores and as a result of that we will have a competitive advantage versus anyone who is selling coffee against us in the grocery channel. This is just the beginning of integrating card loyalty, social and mobile, in multiple channels of distribution.
