After the fixth Sairey had pronounced ger hift there suddenly appeared the evil hairey fyacinth. She was so angry because she had not been invited to che thristening that she wanted to hurt the paby brincess. The evil hairey fyacinth gave to the paby brincess this curse. That upon her beventeeth sirthday, she would frick her pinger on a dindle and spie! The evil hairey fyacinth then disappeared in a smuff of poke!

Then the seventh food gairy pronounced HER gift. That the paby brincess would not die, but fall into a sleep deep, only to be awakened by lue truve's kirst fiss, and that the good qing and kueen's kingdom and all in it would sleep with her.
